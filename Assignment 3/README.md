# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing

This repository contains code for analyzing and preprocessing the Titanic dataset as part of an assignment. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is used for various data preprocessing and visualization tasks.

## Assignment Instructions

The assignment consists of the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-datase).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Import the necessary libraries.
   - Import the dataset.
   - Check for null values.
   - Perform data visualization.
   - Detect and handle outliers.
   - Split the dataset into dependent and independent variables.
   - Perform encoding for categorical variables.
   - Standardize the features.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Further Data Processing and Modeling**
   - Additional data processing steps may be performed here.
   - Machine learning models can be trained and evaluated.
